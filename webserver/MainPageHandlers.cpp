"	</p>																												"

"	<h1>Buying, selling and sharing ownership of														"
"	Substrata parcels</h1>																								"
"	<p><b>How can I buy a																								"
"	Substrata parcel?</b></p>																							"
																											
"	<p>																													"
"	Parcels will be regularly available for sale on the Substrata website												"
"	and on OpenSea. The best way to learn about upcoming sales is to													"
"	follow Substrata on Twitter and the parcel sale announcement channel												"
"	on Discord.</p>																										"
																											
"	<p>																													"
"	If there are no auctions running at the moment, you could also try													"
"	and purchase a parcel in the secondary market on OpenSea.</p>														"
"	<p><br/>																											"
"																														"
"	</p>																												"
"	<p><b>Is Substrata																									"
"	built on the blockchain?</b></p>																					"
																											
"	<p>																													"
"	By default, parcels in Substrata are not NFTs. However, once you own												"
"	a parcel you can request that your parcel be minted as an Ethereum													"
"	NFT.</p>																											"
																											
"	<p>																													"
"	In addition, we sometimes mint the parcels as NFTs from the beginning												"
"	and then auction them on OpenSea.</p>																				"
																											
"	<p>																													"
"	Therefore, parcels for sale on the Substrata website will not be NFTs												"
"	(but can be made into NFTs on request), whereas parcels for sale on													"
"	OpenSea will already be NFTs.</p>																					"
"	<p><br/>																											"
"																														"
"	</p>																												"
"	<p><b>How to mint a																									"
"	parcel you own as an NFT</b></p>																					"
																											
"	<p>																													"
"	1) Log into your existing account at the Substrata website:															"
"	<a href=\"https://substrata.info/account\">account</a></p>										"
"	<p>																													"
"	2) In the parcels section you should see the parcels you own listed.</p>											"
"	<p>																													"
"	3) With Metamask installed in your web browser, link your Substrata													"
"	account to your eth address. You do this by signing a message with													"
"	Metamask.</p>																										"
"																										"
"	<p>																													"
"	4) Navigate to the parcel you want to create as an NFT in the account												"
"	section. Click that you want to mint the parcel as an NFT. You do not												"
"	need to pay the eth gas fee for minting the NFT &ndash; that will be												"
"	covered by Substrata.</p>																							"
"																												"
"	<p>																													"
"	5) The request to mint the NFT will be added to the Substrata queue.												"
"	You&rsquo;ll need to wait for the NFT to be minted by Nick. Note,													"
"	this is still a semi-manual process so there may be a delay.</p>													"
"																												"
"	<p>																													"
"	6) Once the minting process is complete, the eth address linked to													"
"	your substrata account will be assigned as the owner of the Substrata												"
"	parcel. The parcel should appear on the OpenSea account for your eth												"
"	address.</p>																										"
"	<p>																													"
"	<br/>																												"
"																														"
"	</p>																												"
"	<p><b>How do I claim																								"
"	ownership of an NFT I bought in Substata itself? </b>																"
"	</p>																												"
"																												"
"	<p>																													"
"	1) Log in to your account (or create one) at the Substrata website:													"
"	<a href=\"https://substrata.info/account\">account</a></p>										"
"	<p>																													"
"	2) If you haven&rsquo;t already, link your Substrata account to the													"
"	eth address you control which owns the Substrata NFT. To do this													"
"	you&rsquo;ll need Metamask installed in your web browser, and to then												"
"	sign a message to prove you own the eth address.</p>																"
"	<p>																													"
"	3) Go to <a href=\"https://substrata.info/prove_parcel_owner_by_nft\">prove parcel owner by nft</a>					"
"	The website should display your linked eth address if you have														"
"	successfully linked your Substrata account to your eth address.</p>													"
"	<p>												"
"	4) Type in the parcel number you own as an NFT (e.g. 151) and click													"
"	the claim parcel button. Wait a few seconds for the process to work.												"
"	Once the process is complete, the parcel should be listed on the													"
"	account page.</p>																									"
"	<p>																													"
"	<br/>																												"
"																														"
"	</p>																												"

"	<p><b>How do I update																								"
"	the screenshots for my parcel on the Substrata website/Opensea?</b></p>												"
"	<p>																													"
"	1) Log into your existing account at the Substrata website:															"
"	<a href=\"https://substrata.info/account\">account</a></p>										"
"	<p>																													"
"	2) In the parcels section you should see the parcels you own listed.												"
"	Click on the parcel for which you want the screenshot to be updated.</p>											"
"	<p>																													"
"	3) Near the bottom of the page you will see &lsquo;Parcel owner														"
"	tools&rsquo;. Click &lsquo;regenerate screenshots&rsquo;.</p>														"
"	<p>																													"
"	4) Wait a few minutes. The images should then update on both the													"
"	Substrata website and OpenSea.</p>																					"
"	<p>																													"
"	Note: the screenshotting process is done by the Screenshot bot. If													"
"	the process isn&rsquo;t working you can check the status of the bot:												"

"																														"
"	</p>																												"
"	<p><b>How do I update																								"

"	1) Log into your existing account at the Substrata website:															"
"	<a href=\"https://substrata.info/account\">account</a></p>										"
"	<p>												"
"	2) In the parcels section you should see the parcels you own listed.												"
"	Click on the parcel for which you want the description to be updated.</p>											"
"	<p>																													"
"	3) Click &lsquo;Edit description&rsquo; and input your changes.</p>													"
"	<p>																													"
"	<br/>																												"
"																														"
"	</p>																												"
"	<p><b>Is it possible to																								"

"	<p><span>Yes,																										"
"	it is possible to add other users as &lsquo;writers&rsquo; of your													"

"	</span>will be able to create, edit and delete objects in your														"
"	parcel. 																											"
"	</p>																												"
"	<p>																													"
"	1) Log into your existing account at the Substrata website:															"
"	<a href=\"https://substrata.info/account\">account</a></p>										"
"	<p>																													"
"	2) On your user page, navigate to the parcel you want to share.</p>													"
"	<p>																													"
"	3) Click &lsquo;add writer&rsquo; and input the Substrata username of												"
"	the user you want to add as a writer for your parcel.</p>															"
"	<p>																													"
"	Another option is you can make your parcel temporarily or permanently												"
"	&lsquo;All Writeable&rsquo; so that any user can add, edit and delete												"
"	objects in your parcel. To do this, select your parcel in world and													"
"	in the object editor check the &lsquo;All Writeable&rsquo; box.</p>													"
"	<p>																													"
"	<br/>																												"
"																														"
"	</p>																												"
"	<h1>Building and creating in Substrata</h1>															"
"	<p><b>How do I create																								"
"	objects in Substrata?</b></p>																						"
"	<p>																													"
"	To create an object in the main world you need to either be in a													"
"	parcel you own or the sandbox (parcel #20). Alternatively you could													"
"	create objects in your personal world where there are no															"
"	restrictions.</p>																									"
"	<p>																													"
"	There are two ways to create models. In the client you can either													"
"	select &lsquo;Add Model / Image / Video&rsquo; and follow the														"
"	dialogue prompts. Or you can create a model inside Substrata using													"
"	voxels by selecting &lsquo;Add Voxels&rsquo; (see the following														"
"	question for more information).</p>																					"
"	<p>																													"
"	<span>Supported model formats are:													"
"	OBJ, GLTF, GLB, VOX, STL and IGMESH</span></p>																		"
"	<p>																													"
"	<span>Supported image formats are:													"
"	JPG, PNG, GIF, TIF, EXR, KTX, KTX2</span></p>																"
"	<p>																													"
"	<span>Supported video formats are:													"
"	MP4</span></p>																										"
"	<p>																													"
"	<span>Note: please do not add models												"
"	with a very large number of polygons, or with large file sizes (including												"
"	textures), as it may cause performance issues for other users.</span></p>											"
"	<p>																													"
"	<br/>																												"
"																														"
"	</p>																												"
"	<p><b>How do voxels																									"
"	work in Substrata?</b></p>																							"
"	<p>																													"
"	<span>You can either add a voxel													"
"	created outside Substrata (i.e. add a 3d model in one of the														"
"	supported formats), or create a voxel inside Substrata itself.</span></p>											"
"	<p>																													"
"	<span>To create a voxel in Subsrata													"
"	move to a parcel where you have edit privileges and click &lsquo;Add												"
"	Voxels&rsquo; &ndash; this creates the first block (a grey cube). A													"
"	help box should pop up with extra information on how to edit voxels.</span></p>										"
"	<p>																													"
"	<span>The main thing to know is that												"
"	once you&rsquo;ve selected the voxel you can &lsquo;Ctrl +															"
"	left-click&rsquo; to add a voxel on the surface of the cube you click												"
"	on. When you hold down Ctrl and hover over a voxel you will see a													"
"	preview of where the new voxel will appear when you click.</span></p>												"
"	<p>																													"
"	<span>Note voxels do not have to													"
"	remain a perfect cube. You can amend the dimensions of the voxel by													"
"	tweaking the &lsquo;Scale&rsquo; of the object in the Editor box.</span></p>										"
"	<p>																													"

"	</p>																												"
"	<p><b>How do I animate																								"

"	</span>																												"
"	</p>																												"
"	<p><span>In																											"
"	short, t</span>o make a script for an object, you edit code in the													"
